# ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION USING BASE64

Base64 encoding is a method of converting binary data into ASCII characters, making it suitable for data transmission over text-based protocols or storage in text-based formats. 
The encrypt function takes a string input, encodes it using Base64, and returns the encoded data as a string. Conversely, the decrypt function takes a Base64 encoded string, decodes it, 
and returns the original data as a string. While Base64 encoding can obfuscate data, it is not a form of encryption and should not be relied upon for secure data transmission or storage. 
Instead, it serves as a means of encoding binary data into a format that is easily printable and transferable using textual mediums.
